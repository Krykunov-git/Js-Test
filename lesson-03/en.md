# Module 2 - Lesson 3 - Arrays

## Example 1 - Basic operations with an array

1. Create an array `genres` with elements "Jazz" and "Blues".
2. Add "Rock and Roll" to the end.
3. Print the first element of the array to the console.
4. Print the last element of the array to the console. The code should work for an array
   random length.
5. Remove the first element and print it to the console.
6. Insert "Country" and "Reggae" at the beginning of the array.

```js
const genres = ;
```

## Example 2 - Arrays and Strings

Write a script to calculate the area of a rectangle with sides, whichvalues
values are stored in the `values` variable as a string. Values guaranteed
separated by a space.

```js
const values = '8 11';
```

## Example 3 - Array iteration

Write a script to iterate over the `fruits` array with a `for` loop. For each array element
print a string in the format `element_number: element_value` to the console.
Element numbering must start from `1`.

```js
const fruits = ['üçé', 'üçá', 'üçë', 'üçå', 'üçã'];
```

## Example 4 -Arrays and Loops 

Write a script that prints the user's name and phone number to the console. 
The `names` and `phones` variables store strings of names and phone numbers,
separated by commas. The sequence number of names and phone numbers in the lines indicates a match.  
 The number of names and phone numbers is guaranteed to be the same.

```js
const names = 'Jacob,William,Solomon,Artemis';
const phones = '89001234567,89001112233,890055566377,890055566300';
```

## Example 5 - Arrays and Strings 

Write a script that prints to the console all the words of a string except the first and
the last one. The resulting string must not start or end 
whitespace character. The script should work for any line.

```js
const string = 'Welcome to the future';
```

## Example 6 - Arrays and Strings

Write a script that "unwraps" a string (reverse letter order) and prints
it to the console.

```js
const string = 'Welcome to the future';
```

## Example 7 - Sorting an array with a loop 

Write a script to sort an array of strings alphabetically by the first letter 
of an element.

```js
const langs = ['python', 'javascript', 'c++', 'haskel', 'php', 'ruby'];
```

## Example 8 - Search for an element

Write a script to find the smallest number in an array. The code should work 
for any array of numbers. Use a loop to solve problems.

```js
const numbers = [2, 17, 94, 1, 23, 37];
let min;
console.log(min); // 1
```
